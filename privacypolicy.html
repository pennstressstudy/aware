            <h1>Privacy Policy of the Penn Aware App</h1>

            <p>
                This privacy policy describes how the Penn Aware App, pennstressstudy@gmail.com,
                Philadelphia, PA ("Penn Stres Study," "we," "us,") collects, uses, and shares information about you
                collected within the app.

                This privacy policy is adapted from the <a href=https://awareframework.com>AWARE Open Source
                    Framework</a>, from which
                this app was built.
            </p>

        <h2 style="display: inline;"> AWARE’s Privacy Policy </h2>
        <p style="display: inline; font-size: x-small;"> - Last modified 1/24/2019 </p>


        <p> This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect,
            why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will
            take the time to read it carefully. When you install AWARE (official client and plugins),
            by default the data is collected and stored solely on your device. As long as you are
            not part of a study, this is always true.
        </p>

        <h2> Information we collect</h2>

        <p>
            We collect information to improve AWARE’s functionalities – from detecting
            which device you have to more complex things like which plugin is misbehaving
            and draining your battery. We collect information in the following ways:

        </p>

        <h3>To understand AWARE’s worldwide usage </h2>

            <p>
                When you install AWARE for the first time, a UUID is assigned to you. This UUID is the
                same for any plugin you install after the client. When you update AWARE, the UUID is maintained.
                If you remove and reinstall AWARE, a new UUID is created. This guarantees your privacy and makes
                sure you can reset the UUID anytime you wish.
            </p>


            <h3>
                To understand AWARE’s Server usage
            </h3>

            <p>
                We provide a dashboard for free for anyone who is using AWARE as a platform to
                collect research data. To better estimate the server’s demand, the client lets
                us know every 15 minutes that your device exists and is still using AWARE.
                We collect:<br>
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>AWARE Device ID</li>
                    <li> timestamp of the keep alive</li>
                    <li>Do you use the Android or iOS client?</li>
                    <li> What package is installed (to distinguish between the official/modified clients and plugins)?</li>
                    <li> Which version of the package is installed (code and name).</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>
                When this Privacy Policy applies
            </h3>

            <p>
                Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the official client and plugins, offered
                by AWARE Framework in the Play Store. It excludes packages created specifically
                for studies, bundled versions of AWARE as a library. Please refer to the specific
                application’s privacy policy.

            </p>

            <h2>
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
            </h2>

            <p>
                When installing AWARE on a mobile phone, a randomly generated 128-bit Unique
                User ID is generated, reset every time the user joins a new study. By design,
                AWARE does not collect any personal identifiers in its data (e.g., contacts’
                phone numbers, users’ calendar events, etc.). By default, the mobile client only
                stores data locally on the users’ phones. Integrating the mobile client with an
                AWARE Server allows replication of the data to a secure remote database. AWARE offers
                data encryption and obfuscation by default, crucial to safeguard the transition between
                local-only data and shared data. The collected data is presented on the user’s mobile phone,
                within the AWARE mobile clients (Android & iOS). During a study deployment, a user can
                withdraw and remove the collected data from the server and the mobile phone at any time,
                directly from his phone. As the data is primarily stored on the users’ device, it can
                be backed up and opened by connecting the device to your computer and using an SQLite
                client. The data is stored in the folder AWARE of the external storage of the device
                (i.e., /Android/data/com.aware.phone/AWARE or /AWARE/, depending on the device manufacturer
                and the availability of external storage).
